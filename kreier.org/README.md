# Logo for kreier.org

This one was created in 2019:

![logo 50](logo50.png)

It is used as favicon and on the website in the top left corner in two sizes:

## Small as logo60

While this file is 50x60 pixel big, the logo itself needs 23x24 pixels

## Larger as logo70.png

![logo 70](logo70.png)

This is 70x70 with the logo itself 36x36. Maybe I can align it better to get a seemingly sharper image. Or make a bigger one, but reference it smaller for retina displays? On my todo list
